Proposal:
Combining two separate Netflix data sets sourced from Kaggle.
Dataset Source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/netflix-top-10-tv-shows-and-films/version/13

Netflix Top 10 Tv Shows and Film:
Data provides list of titles and their rank by country. Does not include any other details (e.g. Directors, Cast etc.)

Netflix Titles:
Data set provides list of over 8800 Netflix TV shows and Movies and includes information such as directors and cast.

Project will be to combine the two data sets for potential analysis e.g. most popular directors per country, film rating data, runtime etc.
